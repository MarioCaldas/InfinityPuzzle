 This project is designed with multiple levels, where players can advance through levels by successfully completing each one.
 The game starts with the first level unlocked, upon completion of a level, the next level becomes available.
 The game includes 20 pre saved levels.
 Players seeking variety can choose to play randomly generated levels.
 On the menu the player can chose the left button to play the pre saved levels or the middle button for playing a random level, the right button would be options but is not implemented yet.
